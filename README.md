# üí´ About Me:
Fullstack Software Engineer with a background in collaborative, <br>mission-driven projects and a passion for building tools that <br>create real impact. I specialize in the PERN stack, with additional <br>experience in Python and Django, and have developed <br>end-to-end applications that center user needs, accessibility, <br>and functionality.<br><br>Most recently, I completed The Marcy Lab School‚Äôs Software <br>Engineering Fellowship, an intensive, year-long program <br>focused on fullstack development, problem-solving, and <br>technical communication. There, I built BrainBud, a project <br>that helps users engage more intentionally with YouTube <br>content by generating actionable ideas from a video and <br>a prompt, combining natural language processing with <br>real-world utility. I also contributed to team-based projects <br>that prioritized scalability and clean architecture.<br><br>In addition to JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and <br>PostgreSQL, I bring experience working with RESTful APIs, <br>JWT authentication, and Git/GitHub workflows. I enjoy <br>diving into both frontend interfaces and backend logic, <br>and I thrive in environments that encourage learning, <br>experimentation, and collaboration.<br><br>Rooted in curiosity and community, I‚Äôm driven by <br>the belief that software can be a powerful tool for <br>connection and equity. As I continue my job search, I‚Äôm <br>seeking fullstack roles, remote or based in NYC, where I <br>can contribute to impactful work, grow alongside a <br>supportive team, and continue learning every day.<br>
